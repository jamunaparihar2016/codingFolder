19. You are given an array/list ARR of N distinct positive integers. You are also given a non-negative integer B.
    Your task is to find all unique combinations in the array whose sum is equal to B. A number can be chosen any number of times from array/list ARR.
    Elements in each combination must be in non-decreasing order.
20. Program to find all possible combinations of elements from two sets of arrays such that the sum of elements is equal to one of the elements 
in the array itself.
